# Comparative-Study-of-Classification-Algorithms-for-Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-PCA
This repository provides an analysis of classification algorithms on the breast cancer dataset, emphasizing the role of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The project aims to identify the most effective model for predicting breast cancer diagnoses, offering insights into each algorithm's performance after applying PCA.

# **Comparative Study of Classification Models with PCA**  

## **Overview**  
This project demonstrates the use of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and evaluates the performance of multiple classification models. The study includes **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **Random Forest**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to assess how PCA influences model performance.  

----------------------------

## **Key Highlights**  
- **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**:  
  Transformed the dataset into a lower-dimensional space while retaining most of the variance.  
- **Model Comparison**:  
  Evaluated models based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- **Insights Visualization**:  
  Comparative results presented through detailed charts and visualizations.  

------

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**
